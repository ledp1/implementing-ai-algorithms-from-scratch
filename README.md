# Implementing AI Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains from-scratch Python implementations of core machine-learning algorithms, built exclusively with NumPy for numerical computation and Matplotlib for visualization. Each implementation is accompanied by clear documentation and plots that illuminate the underlying mathematics and practical considerations.

## Project Structure

- `regression-and-gradient-descent/`
  - Contains implementations of linear regression and gradient descent algorithms
  - Includes house price prediction using multiple linear regression
  - Each implementation includes detailed documentation and visualizations

## Features

- Implements AI algorithms from first principles
- Uses NumPy for efficient numerical computations
- Visualizes data and results with Matplotlib
- Modular code for easy extension

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ledp1/implementing-ai-algorithms-from-scratch.git
   cd implementing-ai-algorithms-from-scratch
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

Navigate to the specific algorithm folder and run any script. Each implementation includes:
- Detailed documentation
- Sample data or examples
- Visualization of results
- Explanation of the underlying concepts
